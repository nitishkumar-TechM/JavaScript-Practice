    <h1>Bitwise Operator</h1>

    <p>
        <h3>
        
        Bitwise operators treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits (zeros and ones),<br>
        rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.<br>
        For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001.<br>
        Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations,<br>
        but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.<br>
        
        </h3>
