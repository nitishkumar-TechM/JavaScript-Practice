    <h1>Function Declarations vs Function Expression</h1>

    <h2>Function Declaration</h2>
    <p>A function declaration defines a named function that can be called later in the code.</p>
    <pre>
        function greet() {
            console.log("Hello, World!");
        }
    </pre>
    <p>When we defining the function using function declaration syntax, so we can <br>
        call the function before it is defined in the code.
        But this is not possible with function expressions.
    </p>

    <p>The reason for this is because when our JavaScript engine executes this code, <br>
        it hoists/moves the function declaration to the top of the scope, <br>
        allowing us to call the function before it is defined.
    </p>

    <h3>Hoisting</h3>
    <p>
        Hoisting is the process of moving declarations to the top of their scope before the code is executed. <br>
        This means that function declarations are available throughout their scope, even before they are defined in the code. <br>
        And this done automatically by the JavaScript engine that is executing the code.
    </p>
