    <h1>Adding Elements</h1>

    <p> <h3>const numbers = [3, 4] </h3></p>
    <p> Note that here we declared <strong>numbers</strong> as a constant, <br>
        that means we cannot reassign <strong>numbers</strong> to something else,<br>
        if we do this, we get error.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it's perfectly fine to modify the content of this array.
