    <h1>Objects Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Objects are collection of key value pairs.<br>
        If we have properties that are highly related,<br>
        we want to encapsulate them inside an object.

        Object Oriented Programming is basically a style of <br>
        programming where we see a program as a collection of <br>
        objects that talk to each other to perform some functionality.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        In Object oriented progtramming term, if a function is <br>
        part of an object, we call that function a <strong>method</strong>.
