    <H1>Prototypes and Prototypical Inheritance</H1>

    <p>
        In JavaScript, every object has a prototype.<br>
        A prototype is also an object.<br>
        Every Object has a prototype object excepts the Root object. <br>
        All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.<br>
        The prototype of an object can be accessed using the <br>
        <code>__proto__</code> property or the <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> method. <br>
        eg.- let x = {};<br>
        Object.getPrototypeOf(x);<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        A prototype is essentially a parent of another object. <br>
        Every Object in javaScript accepts only a single object.
    </p>

    <p>
        The prototype chain is a series of links between objects that allows JavaScript to look up properties and methods.<br>
        When you try to access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first checks if the object has that property or method.<br>
        If it doesn't, it looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches the end of the chain.<br>
        So, this called prototypical inheritance in action.<br>
