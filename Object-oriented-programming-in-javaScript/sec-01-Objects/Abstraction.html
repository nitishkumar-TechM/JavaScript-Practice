    <h1>Abstrction in JS</h1>

    <h3>Closure</h3>
    <p> A Closure in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to <br>
        the outer (enclosing) function's variables. This includes the outer <br>
        function's scope chain. Closures are created every time a function is created, <br>
        at function creation time.
